"Tip for a day" is an extension that shows occasional tip every time when server start. 
It consists of two part: the tip4day.war file and the tip4day-rest.jar file.

For the correct work you should copy the tip4day.war file in $PLATFORM_TOMCAT_HOME/webapps folder,
 the tip4day-rest.jar file to $PLATFORM_TOMCAT_HOME/lib folder and restart the server.
